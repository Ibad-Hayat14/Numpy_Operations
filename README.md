# NumPy Operations – Python Notebook 

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook titled **`Numpy_Operation.ipynb`** that demonstrates the fundamental and advanced functionalities of the NumPy library,a cornerstone of numerical computing in Python.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook covers:

### Basics
- Creating 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- Array reshaping and flattening

### ⚙Mathematical Operations
- Element-wise operations
- Aggregate functions (`sum`, `mean`, `std`, etc.)
- Sorting and filtering

### Advanced NumPy Concepts
- Conditional selection using `np.where()`
- Logical operations with `np.any()` and `np.all()`
- Set operations (`union1d`, `intersect1d`, `setdiff1d`)
- Boolean indexing
- Broadcasting
- Clipping array values with `np.clip()`
- Memory differences between `copy()` and `view()`
- Random sampling with `np.random`
- Linear algebra operations (`dot`, `inv`)
- Saving and loading arrays (`.npy` format)
